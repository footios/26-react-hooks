Hooks we check:
* useState()
* useEffect()
* useContext()
* useReducer()
* useRef()
* useMemo()
* Creating a Custom Hook.
*"And creating your own hooks is super simple and allows you to extract functionality
out of a component and share it across multiple components, pretty much like a mixin.
Then we use the `state` in our own hook but __important__,
there's __only one state management container__ so to say in React for the entire React app, so we can
actually hook into the state from anywhere with a gotcha. Anywhere has to be a class-based component, a functional component with hooks or our own hooks. 
And you can build your own hooks for anything, for logging, for analytics, HTTP requests, form handling, more
advanced form handling, whatever you can imagine
and this reusability and this feature of being able to use your own hooks or to build your own hooks,
where you can also use the React hooks,
that is an amazing part of the React hooks specification too because you now have a way of easily sharing
functionality across components and with functionality,
I really mean __functionality that uses core React features__ like state setting and that is an awesome
part of the React hooks specification with which I wanted to conclude this module."*
